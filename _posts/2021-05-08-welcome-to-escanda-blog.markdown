Hi there!

I am a software dev from Spain working on mostly JVM related languages and technologies. I dabble as well from time to time as devOps on K8s and Docker.

I am also really interested on some ancient technologies such as Lisps.

I run a Software Consultancy named _Escanda Software OU_.

You can find me on [twitter][twitter] as well as on [my company's website][escandacc].
